# e_voting
A voting application built with Flask
e-voting system is an online voting platform to conduct student council election online. In the implementation, we create an e-voting system where a student can register themself by filling in the required details. We consider only two positions (President and Vice-President) for the current implementation. For a registered student to cast their vote, they need to log into the system. After logging onto the system, a voting form will be displayed and voters can allocate their votes for respective positions as they see fit. Since itâ€™s an online voting system, it should also have a system in place that can stream live results based on the cast votes. There is also an admin login so that admin can register, remove and update candidate for the give two position.
